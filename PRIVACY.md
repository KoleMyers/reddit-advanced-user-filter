# Privacy Policy for Reddit Advanced User Filter

## Overview

This privacy policy explains how Reddit Advanced User Filter ("the extension") handles your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

This extension does not collect, track, or transmit any personal data. All data is stored locally on your device:

- Your Reddit API credentials (client ID and OAuth token) are stored in your browser's local storage
- Filter settings are stored in your browser's local storage
- A list of filtered users and their posts is stored in your browser's local storage

## Data Storage

All data is stored on your device using the browser's storage API. The extension does not use any external servers or databases. The only external requests made are:

- Reddit API requests to fetch user data (required for filtering)
- Reddit OAuth authentication (required for API access)

## Third-Party Services

This extension interacts with:
- Reddit API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api)
- Reddit OAuth (https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize)

These services have their own privacy policies and terms of service. The extension only uses these services for the essential functionality of fetching user data for filtering.

## Data Retention

- All data is stored on your device
- Data persists until you uninstall the extension or clear your browser data
- You can clear all stored data by uninstalling the extension
- No data is retained on any external servers

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access all data stored by the extension
